If object detection and segmentation are the “real-world build stuff” of computer vision, then in NLP the practical equivalents are systems that understand, extract, generate, and interact using language.

Here are the core, hands-on NLP project categories — the ones that actually matter in production:

1️⃣ Text Classification (Foundation Project)

Computer Vision equivalent: Image classification

What you build:

Spam detection

Sentiment analysis

Toxic comment detection

News/topic classification

Intent classification for chatbots

Real-world example:
Classifying customer reviews as positive/negative or routing support tickets automatically.

2️⃣ Named Entity Recognition (NER)

CV equivalent: Object detection

Instead of detecting objects in images, you detect structured entities in text.

What you build:

Extract names, locations, dates, organizations

Resume parser

Medical report entity extraction

Legal contract entity tagging

Example:
Extracting company names and amounts from financial documents.

3️⃣ Information Extraction & Relation Extraction

CV equivalent: Instance-level detection + relationship modeling

You don’t just detect entities — you understand how they relate.

What you build:

Extract “Person X works at Company Y”

Knowledge graph building

Event extraction

Automated structured database filling

This is serious production-level NLP.

4️⃣ Question Answering Systems

CV equivalent: Visual question answering

What you build:

Context-based QA (SQuAD-style)

Document QA system

FAQ automation bot

Knowledge-base assistant

This evolves into building your own domain-specific AI assistant.

5️⃣ Chatbots & Conversational AI

CV equivalent: Interactive vision systems

What you build:

Rule-based chatbot

Retrieval-based bot

Generative chatbot

Multi-turn contextual assistant

Modern stack:

Transformer models

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

Memory handling

Tool usage

This is where serious AI product development happens.

6️⃣ Text Summarization

CV equivalent: Image captioning

What you build:

News summarizer

Meeting transcript summarizer

Legal document shortener

YouTube transcript condenser

Two types:

Extractive

Abstractive (LLM-based)

7️⃣ Machine Translation

CV equivalent: Style transfer

What you build:

English ↔ Tamil translation

Domain-specific translation (medical/legal)

Subtitle generation tool

Production-level MT is still a high-impact system.

8️⃣ Text Generation Systems

CV equivalent: Image generation

What you build:

Blog/article generator

Code generator

Email drafting assistant

Story generator

This is where LLM fine-tuning and prompt engineering matter.

9️⃣ Search Engines & Semantic Retrieval

CV equivalent: Image similarity search

What you build:

Document retrieval system

Resume-job matching engine

Semantic search over PDFs

Vector database pipeline

Core skills:

Embeddings

FAISS / Vector DB

RAG pipelines

This is extremely practical and industry-relevant.

🔟 Speech-Based NLP (Bonus)

Speech-to-text

Voice assistant

Emotion detection from speech

Call center analytics

🔥 If You Want Industry-Grade Projects

Here are serious portfolio-level builds:

Domain-specific chatbot with RAG

Resume parser + job matcher

Legal document analyzer

Customer support automation system

Knowledge graph builder from raw text

AI meeting assistant (transcribe → summarize → extract action items)

Multi-lingual semantic search engine

The Big Difference

Computer Vision projects mostly focus on perception.
NLP projects often combine:

Understanding

Structured extraction

Reasoning

Retrieval

Generation

Conversation

Modern NLP projects are system design problems, not just model training problems.
